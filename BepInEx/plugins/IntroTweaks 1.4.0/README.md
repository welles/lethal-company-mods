# IntroTweaks
A highly configurable solution to all of your intro/menu problems.

## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) v5 into your game.
2. Download `IntroTweaks.dll` and drop it into `Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins`.

## Features
- Skips the **Unity** and **Zeekerss** splash screens!
- Seamlessly skips the boot and launch mode screens.
- Applies various fixes to the menu canvas and its panels.
- Aligns the main menu buttons with each other.
- Provides other useful options (startup display, auto select host, remove credits button).
- Improves look of the version text and moves it to the bottom center.
- Compatible with **LethalExpansion** and **MoreCompany**.

## Important Notes
This mod will hide the original game version text, other mods should not be editing it directly - please take that up with them.

Unless disabled, IntroTweaks aligns the menu buttons by default which other mods may not respect if they implement their own buttons.
