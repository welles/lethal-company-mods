- Makes the Item Dropship arrive and leave faster.
- The Item Dropship will arrive within 10 seconds of buying items, and will depart after 3 seconds of opening the dropship doors, or after 40 seconds, whichever is sooner.
- Buying items while the dropship landing, but before it has fully lands, will add the items to its inventory so you don't have to wait for the next dropship.
- All settings can now be edited in the config!
- Sanic not included.
