# CoilHeadStare - made by TDP

This mod makes the Coilhead slowly turn its head to stare at you after standing close to it for a while. Because it just isn't scary enough already.

*You are looking right at it. It shouldn't be able to move, right? Slowly, its head begins to turn towards you, menacingly. Mocking you. It knows you can't escape.*

This is a client-mod, anyone who has it installed will see the Coilhead stare at the closest player.

Values like the speed at which the head turns are tweakable in the config file.
